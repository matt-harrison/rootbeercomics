<p>Spoiler Alert: Roger the homunculus is dead and the B.P.R.D. is bummed about it. On a trip to France to acquire an ancient text that could restore him, field coordinator Kate Corrigan is abducted by an equally ancient collector of such artifacts, who hopes to add Roger to his collection. Meanwhile, back at headquarters, the rest of the paranormals break up the monotony of a slow week by telling ghost stories. Of course, being ghosts and monsters themselves, their stories are true. Here, finally, we learn the secret origin of Captain Daimio's horrible (excellent) scar, the story of his (temporary) death.</p>
<p>Everything about that is great. Either one of those plotlines would be fascinating, together they're a marvel.</p>
<p>More of the same great art. More of the same great characters. More of the same great storytelling.</p>
<p>Just great. Nothing more to say.</p>
