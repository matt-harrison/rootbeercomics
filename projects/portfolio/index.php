    <p id="about" class="mb20">Matt Harrison is a full-time web developer and freelance illustrator. Above all, Matt loves to read. Fiction, non-fiction, comics, news and entertainment articles, Matt devours the written word. Matt has produced several short literary pieces as part of his coursework toward a Creative Writing degree at Old Dominion University, and he continues to write and draw independently-produced, decidedly uncommercial comic books with any creative energy not spent at the office.</p>
