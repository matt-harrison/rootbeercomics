        <p>EXT. PARKING LOT - MINUTES BEFORE DUSK</p>
        <p>A steady shot of a brick wall, the side of a small building, an island in a suburban shopping center. Parking spaces line the wall, but only a few are occupied. A modern car, nothing too fancy, is parked in a spot near the middle of the wall. An old car, spouting abrasive music, abruptly pulls up beside the dormant vehicle, obscuring our view. The engine cuts off and the passenger door flings open wildly, hitting the next car with a quick, loud pop.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">ALVIN</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">Shit!</span>
        </p>
        <p>The door slams closed. The engine starts again, the music picks up where it left off, and the car rolls backward out of the spot several feet, then angles away and into the next space. The doors open again and three young men climb out of the car, SIMON from the driver's seat, ALVIN and TED from the passenger side. Simon leans over the roof to gauge the damage that Alvin has just caused to the other vehicle.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">SIMON</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">Christ! Can you tell?</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">ALVIN</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">No, I don't think so. It'll be fine, dude. </span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">TED</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">(trying to muffle his voice, yelling in a whisper)</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">What do you mean, "fine"? It's not fine. You dented it!</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">ALVIN</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">Where?</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">TED</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">Right there! Right fucking there!</span>
        </p>
        <p>Ted indicates a vertical scar along the door of the other vehicle.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">ALVIN</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">Oh, shit. You're right. My fault.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">SIMON</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">Ok, ok, just ignore it. Maybe they won't notice.</span>
        </p>
        <p>The boys turn their backs on the damage and walk around to the near side of their car. Alvin leans against the door, as Simon and Ted vaguely inspect the exterior of the building, while still trying to look casual.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">TED</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">So, this is it. This is...</span>
        </p>
        <p>A heavyset woman leading her young son by the wrist rounds the corner of the building. As they cross the empty parking spaces, Simon glances at the damaged car, then distances himself a little, trying to look inconspicuous.</p>
        <p>The child's attention is focused on the action figure that crisscrosses through the air in his hand. His other hand tugs vaguely from beyond his mother's clutch, where it cannot contribute to articulating the action. The boy's eyes glazed, he boy mutters sound effects, almost unconsciously, more watching the toy's performance than controlling it.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">WOMAN</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">Come on, sweetie.</span>
        </p>
        <p>The mother tugs more forcefully. Her son ignores the command, enrapt in his fantasy. The boy speaks excitedly to his toy under his breath - that vacant, almost soundless impression of powerfully loud voices. He is improvising a dialogue between his toy and some unseen players.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">KID</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">Come on! You can do it!</span>
        </p>
        <p>He swings his arm, illustrating some grand maneuver, and the toy clatters across the pavement, settling near Ted's feet. Ted pretends not to notice.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">WOMAN</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">You dropped your guy.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">KID</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">He fell off the cliff, Mom. He fell in the lava.</span>
        </p>
        <p>Releasing her grasp, she crouches slightly, resting her hand on the boy's back, angling him toward the group, now watching.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">WOMAN</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">Go get him.</span>
        </p>
        <p>Without approaching, the boy looks up at Ted, meeting his eyes, then quickly turns away.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">KID</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">Hnn...</span>
        </p>
        <p>The mother senses her son's timidity, steps forward and bends down to retrieve the toy herself. As she rises, she smiles generically at Ted. She is friendly, but he is of no interest to her.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">TED</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">Hi.</span>
        </p>
        <p>Simon watches intently as the pair walks out of the shot, to some other car, not pictured.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">SIMON</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">Man, I wish I was still a kid.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">ALVIN</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">No way. It sucked being a kid. I was always grounded. </span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">SIMON</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">That's not what I mean. It's nice to live on your own, but...</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">TED</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">You don't live on your own, dude. You sleep on Alvin's couch.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">SIMON</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">Shut up, Ted. You still live with your parents. </span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">TED</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">Yeah, but I don't have to pay for groceries, either.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">SIMON</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">It's just... it was nice, ya know? All you had to worry about was where your next G.I. Joe was gonna come from.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">TED</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">What, you wish you could still play with toys?</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">ALVIN</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">Aw, shit yeah, dude. Let's go get some cap guns for this, the realistic looking ones. </span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">SIMON</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">No, man. We told you. No guns. </span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">ALVIN</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">Yeah, but technically these wouldn't be guns.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">TED</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">Alvin, if you show a gun in a bank, you get shot at. </span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">ALVIN</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">We don't have to show them.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">TED</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">Then what is the point?!</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">SIMON</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">What are you guys taking about? I'm trying to say... Goddamn it, nevermind. </span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">ALVIN</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">So then we can bring guns?</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">SIMON</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">Ted. Goddamn it. No. Fucking. Guns. Period.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">TED</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">But this is it, huh? This place?</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">SIMON</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">Yeah, the setup is pretty perfect. We just park over there, keep the engine running. No one would even be able to see the car from inside.</span>
        </p>
        <p>Simon and Ted round the corner of the building and approach the entrance. We see the name of the bank, "NAVY FEDERAL CREDIT UNION," in bold letters along the upper edge of the building. Ted peers in through the large windows that make up the entrance of the building, cupping his hands around his eyes and pressing against the glass to see through its dark, reflective surface.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">TED</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">They're closed, right?</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">SIMON</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">Actually, we're a little...</span>
        </p>
        <p>The nearer of the bank's double doors suddenly opens outward as a young, clean-cut businessman exits. Ted recoils from the window, terrified, and assumes a rigid posture as he turns his back to the building. The man looks Simon in the face as he passes, nodding a little, only half sincere. His glance passes quickly and he is gone, unaffected and uninterested.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">TED</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">Dude!</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">SIMON</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">They close in a few minutes.</span>
        </p>
        <p>They walk back around to the side of the building, rejoining Alvin, who is now leaning against the driver side door, biting his nails absentmindedly.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">TED</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">Well, I like it, I guess. The view is completely limited to the front. That'll cut down on witnesses, I think.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">ALVIN</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">I thought we wanted to rob a bank. This is a credit union. </span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">SIMON</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">It's the same thing.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">ALVIN</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">Does a credit union even have a safe?</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">SIMON</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">It doesn't matter. We couldn't get into the safe even if they had one. It's not worth the time it would take trying to figure a way in.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">ALVIN</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">Do you think they have actual Navy dudes, like, posted in there? </span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">TED</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">It's just a bank, Alvin. It's a bank for people in the Navy.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">ALVIN</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">Yeah, but do you think we'll run into any of them? Those dudes go through a lot of training. I mean, I'm not sure I could take a guy like that. Maybe if it was three against one.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">SIMON</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">We're not gonna have to fight anyone, Alvin. The whole idea is that no one around even notices what's happening.</span>
        </p>
        <p>Alvin starts to wander away.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">TED</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">Where are you going?</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">ALVIN</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">The ATM. I gotta get that twenty-five I owe Simon.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">TED</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">You can't go up there now, you idiot. Someone will notice you.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">ALVIN</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">Wouldn't it be worse if they noticed that we're all just standing here?</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">SIMON</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">That's actually a good point. All right, go ahead. </span>
        </p>
        <p>Alvin wanders away toward the front of the building. Simon turns toward Ted, but keeps his eyes on Alvin. As Alvin disappears around the corner, Simon mutters to himself.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">SIMON</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">Plus, I want my fucking money. </span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">TED</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">Can we really trust him, dude? He's a good guy and all, but you know he's a little spacey. People notice things like that.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">RICK (V.O.)</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">Hey, Ted!</span>
        </p>
        <p>Another person approaches. He looks like he might be a few years younger than the others. As he gets close, he and Ted clasp hands, a greeting that soon becomes an awkwardly improvised mockery of a handshake. They release, and Ted glances quizzically at his own hand.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">TED</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">Simon, this is my friend Rick.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">RICK</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">Hey, dude.</span>

            <span class="dBlock txtC">SIMON</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">Drick? Your name is Drick?</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">RICK</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">What? No, it's Rick. Rick.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">SIMON</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">Oh. Ok, that's normal.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">RICK</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">So, um... what are you guys doing up here?</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">TED</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">Oh, uh... Alvin had to use the ATM.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">RICK</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">Cool. Yeah, my girlfriend's getting some cash so we can go get Mexican food.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">SIMON</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">Man, I'm hungry. We should go get some nachos after this.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">RICK</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">Did you hear that this bank got robbed?</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">TED</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">What? This one? </span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">RICK</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">Yeah. My friend Casey works here. She wasn't here at the time, though. That would have been awesome.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">TED</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">This bank? When?</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">RICK</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">Just last week. Maybe... five, six days ago. It was closed for a couple of days. I guess they made off with like seven hundred dollars, something like that.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">SIMON</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">That's it?</span>
        </p>
        <p>Alvin returns from the ATM.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">ALVIN</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">I could only get cash in multiples of twenty. Hey, Rick.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">RICK</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">Hey, Al.</span>

            <span class="dBlock auto w400">Hell yes.</span>

        <p>Alvin's attention falters. He does not get offended, and makes no effort to catch up with the portion of the conversation that he's missed. He is suddenly captivated by something he notices on the back of one of the twenty dollar bills, and continues to scrutinize it.</p>

            <span class="dBlock auto w400">That was probably just some asshole without a plan, some desperate bastard who ran in there, pointing a gun and making demands. We could take way more than that if we're smart about it.</span>

        <p>The same two kids return on their skateboards, from the direction where we saw them leave.</p>

        </p>
        <p>The first kid ollies up onto the high ledge and pushes over to back up against the glass doors again. The second kid carries his board up the curb and leans against the wall of the building, out of sight from the doors.</p>
        <p>The first kid pushes off, rides up fast and spins a three-sixty off the end of the ledge. As his board clatters away, his feet hit the pavement together and he tumbles onto his back.</p>

        <p>He drops the board and stands on it with his front foot. He pushes off from his back foot, rolls quickly to the end of the sidewalk and ollies down over the curb. He bobs awkwardly as he lands, but manages to hold on. He carries the board back to the second boy.</p>
        <p>As the boy takes his board back in his hands, the security guard bursts out through the front doors.</p>

        <p>He goes back once again around the corner of the building. The old man is knocking on the door, the thick glass making a bonging noise. A pretty young woman approaches the door from inside, and smiling, turns the latch and lets the old man in. She places her hand on his back as he moves through the doorway, then locks the door again.

            <span class="dBlock txtC">ALVIN</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">I mean it. Old dudes are awesome. I'm gonna be the coolest old dude ever. Wearing sweet Sherlock Holmes hats and shit. Having old guy meetings in Wendy's, all that stuff. </span>

            <span class="dBlock auto w400">He could barely walk, Alvin. Getting older fucking sucks.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">ALVIN</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">Nah, dude. You underestimate old dudes. Everybody does. Did you see him get right into that bank? He's probably in there robbing the place right now. He's probably the one who did it before. He's probably on a crime spree, hitting banks all over the place. </span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">SIMON</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">Hmm.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">ALVIN</span>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">(looking around)</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">I wonder if those kids are coming back. I wanna skate some more.</span>
        </p>
        <p>The woman lets the old man out of the bank again, and he smiles and waves to her as she locks up behind him. He acknowledges the group as he nears them again.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">OLD MAN</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">Nice day, isn't it?</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">SIMON</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">Yeah, nice day. </span>

            <span class="dBlock txtC">OLD MAN</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">What are you kids doing up here? Are you one of those skateboard gangs?</span>
        </p>
        <p>Alvin looks around, puzzled. There are clearly no skateboards in the area.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">SIMON</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">Do you own this place or something?</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">OLD MAN</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">What's that, son?</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">SIMON</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">How did you get in there after they closed?</span>

        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">OLD MAN</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">Hmm? Oh, well... I guess sometimes folks'll just sorta go outta their way for an old timer, especially a veteran.</span>
        </p>
        <p>He pulls his sleeve over his forearm to reveal an ancient looking anchor tattoo. His posture changes. He's proud of his life, and young people don't often ask him about it.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">ALVIN</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">You get away with stuff like that all the time, don't you?</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">OLD MAN</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">Heh. One of the many perks of being retired, I suppose.</span>

        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">ALVIN</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">Yeah, and you get a discount on, like, movies and food and stuff, too, huh?</span>

        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">OLD MAN</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">Oh, sure. Lots of discounts.</span>

            <span class="dBlock auto w400">What time did you wake up this morning?</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">SIMON</span>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">(cutting Alvin off)</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">Who was in there? How many people?</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">OLD MAN</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">Why? You thinking about robbing the place?</span>
        </p>
        <p>He chuckles at his own joke.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">SIMON</span>
            <span class="dBlock auto w400">Maybe we are.</span>

        <p>

        </p>
        <p>He limps off eagerly. Simon is reflective. There is a pause.</p>
        <p>
            <span class="dBlock txtC">SIMON</span>

        <p>The gang climbs back into the old car. The music stutters as the engine starts up again, and they pull out of the spot and drive off.</p>
