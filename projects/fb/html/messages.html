<div class="subject">Hey!</div>

So I am wrong anout the Swedes! Alas! I was wondering if you would be interested/willing in drawing or designing our wedding invitations. We would be willing to commission you for the work. We were thinking of the look below. What do you think?

<div class="subject">Talk to me about a thing...</div>

First off, that bear drawing is my favorite.  Can I have one?<BR><BR>More importantly, talk to me about this whole 4262 for Kids thing...<BR><BR>1. What if I take some time off and ignore the project entirely until... after the Holidays? January?  Could I just put everything on the new site and say: This is what I did.  This is who it helped.  Here's an idea of what could be awesome down the line.<BR><BR>2.  Can I set it up in a way such that I don't commit to doing anything with this again?  Could I just pay the &quot;administrative 501c3 filing costs&quot; ($400) I still have set aside to the two groups here who already have received some money and be done with it for a little while?  <BR><BR>3. I don't think of this project as a very high priority in my life right now and I'm being very hesitant to take some steps forward because I know I only have a small amount of energy (hours per week/month) to commit to this.  Is that ok?  It would take a great weight off my shoulders to not feel like I'm not doing enough with this and that I'm letting people down.  Specifically with you, I feel that you've put in some effort and I haven't done anything to merit that.<BR><BR>4. I'm talking to Tamara on the phone about this, but she just got off for a few to go put in some laundry so i have all these thoughts inmyheadandnoonetosaythemto!!  So, you're getting an e-mail.<BR><BR>5.  What else ya up to?<BR><BR>6.  Oh, serious talk:  Can I ask you about marriage? Like, can you and I have some lunch sometime soon and talk about being married?  Specifically I'd like to know how you and lovely Laura are, but also... I got some real real feelings for this Tamara girl.  I'm thinkin' about it for in the next couple years with here.  EEep!<BR><BR>7. Back to 4262 stuff:<BR>(a) Migrate to the new site.<BR>(b) Post up the new information about where the project is without putting up anything about how to join the team or specifics just yet.<BR>(c) blog post about taking a break and &quot;Life! Sheesh!&quot; and send out that information to my e-mail newsletter list.<BR>(d) Actually let myself not touch this for a while.  I get such awesome ideas and am able to get excite about something like this when i'm not so unsure and unattracted to it.<BR>(e) Pick it back up in January new and come at it however I want to then.<BR><BR>8. How's it sound, buddy?  I ask you opinion because I respect you and I feel like I might be being a dick to you for your wasted efforts.<BR><BR>9.  Honestly, I loved being on the road for that long.  I loved planning out that next trip all summer and will probably be very stoked about it again.  I'm just not now.  I need to take a break rather than feel like I'm not living up to my commitments for a while.  I hope you understand.<BR><BR>Let me know what your think but please don't make your response as long as mine, I'm a very busy man.<BR><BR>xoxo<BR>-Zack<BR><BR>PS! I miss you!

Hey good ol' buddy.  <BR><BR>Ok, so several times over the last week or so I've had the best of intentions.   I swear.

Hey Matt,<BR>Hope you and Laura are doing well.  Tell her I said hi and would like to hang out sometime.  Sorry to bother you , but I did have a quick question.  I remember that you went to ECPI and my boyfriend is looking into going there.  I was just wondering how your experience was and if you'd reccommend someone going through their program.

ECPI was pretty expensive but it's been worth it for me. i didn't necessarily learn everything i needed to know from them (though i hear they've improved on that front since i left anyway), but they give you the basics you need to pick the rest up on the job and they make SURE you can get an internship, which is the only way to break into the industry. <BR><BR>so, yeah, it's a big investment, but if it's what he wants to do then it's definitely a good foot in the door.<BR><BR>hope that helps.

<div class="subject">june!</div>

hello team.<BR><BR>i hope that this message finds you both well and warm, surrounded by books, blankets, toys, and cats.<BR><BR>i wanted to write to say hello, see how things were going, see if everything is still going according to plan marriage-wise (date, etc.). i have managed to become confused about the date of the ceremony - it's thursday the 17th of june, right? <BR><BR>1. have you sent out &quot;save the date&quot; letters, or invitations? the clock is ticking! <BR><BR>2. laura, i trust that you have become impregnated so that there will be a fiasco with the fit of your wedding dress.<BR><BR>3. matt, i hope that you have picked out a suede jacket with coattails and a badass cane. a man shouldn't be married in anything less than the finest apparel the local thrift store has to offer.<BR><BR>4. but for real, and i'm not fucking around here, let me know. i have a goddamn vacation to plan after all of this hard work in mexico and want to be sure i'll be back in time to say a few words, get tipsy, and dance with the bride.<BR><BR>5. other than that, how the hell are you both?

buenas dias!<BR><BR>don't save june 17th. save june 24th instead. you'd know that if i had a mexican address for you (uno dos tres calle de nacho) because: <BR><BR>1. yes, the save the dates have been mailed. invitations will be forthcoming. <BR><BR>2. laura's mom's dress didn't work out, as anticipated, but she has already purchased a new dress that makes her very happy. i haven't seen it.<BR><BR>3. the men's dresscode has not yet been determined, but i think coattails might clash with the heavy fringe i'm picturing.<BR><BR>4. good man.<BR><BR>5. damn decent, brother. damn decent. you're missing a winter freakin' wonderland over here.

two months to go! i have some thoughts about this and that (regarding what i should say), but they are not quite formed yet. <BR><BR>1. perhaps you both could describe to me what you desire for the structure of the ceremony, meaning:<BR><BR>2. what you desire from me regarding the length, content, bad jokes, if you have discussed your vows, etc.<BR><BR>3. i suppose that i need to know the atmosphere which you both are trying to achieve - but judging from the save the date notice (which is awesome), nothing super duper formal? i mean, i know that you're not going to be wearing matching camouflage outfits and standing on the back of a hay wagon, but i would like some indication of how the ceremony will proceed.<BR><BR>4. also, i would like to know both of your thoughts on the matter...if possible...that way we can all work as a team to make this awesome and ensure that both of your desires/needs are met.<BR><BR>5. also, if you'd prefer to talk on the phone rather than write, i can call. it's only $.02 per min to talk on skype.<BR><BR>6. in the meantime - more things for your eyes: <a href="http://www.facebook.com/l/f7b39;www.nytimes.com/2010/04/18/magazine/18marriage-t.html?ref=magazine&amp;pagewanted=all">http://www.facebook.com/l/f7b39;www.nytimes.com/2010/04/18/magazine/18marriage-t.html?ref=magazine&amp;pagewanted=all</a>

ted,<BR><BR>hola, mi amigo! how's mexico treating you? i hear your experience has been full of yoga and spicy food. (could be a bad combination!) let me try to address each of your comments...<BR><BR>1. ceremony: short and sweet. <BR><BR>2. structure: you will say something about bringing everyone together to celebrate the occasion, perhaps make a joke at matt's expense, we'll go through the vows, you'll pronounce us man and wife, then we'll all rock out to Queen. <BR><BR>3. atmosphere: secular, semi-formal. my dress has a bit of a train, but i don't think matt even plans to wear a suit jacket. so it's somewhere between here and there, i guess. definitely approaching this thing with a sense of humor, because that's the only thing we know how to do. (i'm not saying that we're funny, just that we try.)<BR><BR>this probably isn't very helpful for you, but it's a starting point. i hope there will be more dialogue to come. in the mean time, matt and i will be applying for a marriage license within the next few weeks. we still plan to get legally married the morning of the wedding, if possible. <BR><BR>buenos noches, mi hermano!<BR><BR>-laura

<div class="subject">4262 mi for Kids!</div>

Hey there pals. This is obviously a mass message so please just bear with me for a minute.<BR><BR>This summer I'm riding a bike from roughly Richmond, VA to Portland, OR to raise awareness and funding for a few local and national non-profits. My focus will be on groups like Books on Wheels, U-Locks of Love, Safe Routes to Schools and a few others who are doing good to get kids on bikes and give them a safe place to ride. That's where you come in.<BR><BR>Who should get the money? I want the advice of anyone who has an opinion on the matter before I make a commitment to these groups. I want a total of only six legitimate NPOs to receive funding so that they can each get a significant portion of the proceeds. So, if you know of any smaller groups even even any larger ones that I've failed to notice, please let me know.<BR><BR>Thanks everyone for your help. I think I can make a big impact with this stunt, I just want to make sure I'm doing it to help the right people.<BR><BR>-Zack<BR><a href="http://www.facebook.com/l/f7b39;www.4262forkids.com">http://www.facebook.com/l/f7b39;www.4262forkids.com</a><BR><BR>ps. If you're not an Onion Ring, Kitton Mittons or a restaurant, you probably got this message. I think I sent this to every human on my friends list. If you would like to opt-out of future mailings, please just say so. No hard feelings.

So my wife and I are organizing a sort of flea market/craft fair type deal to be held November 14th (Sat) at The Warehouse (close to Tortilla West, Cruzers, Orapax, etc.) and I was wondering if you wanted to participate.<BR><BR>Last time we did this we had about a dozen vendors selling stuff as varied as comics, records, DVD's, hand-made jewelry, second-hand clothes, art, photography, etc. I have a few more friends interested in selling their art at this one too, and it occurred to me that maybe you might have some stuff to contribute. If not, no sweat - maybe swing by and check it out when it happens, but if you do that'd be awesome. I don't know if you ever met Nick Perrit, but he's a friend of Jon and mine, and he's selling some sketches and old GI JOes and whatnot too - so maybe that's up your alley.<BR><BR>Anyhow, hope all is well. Catch you soon,<BR>Ryan<BR><BR>Oh, you can find out more about this thing by doing a search fo Swag Swap on fb.

well, when you are dealing with flash the specifics tend to make a big difference, but if i were provided with the graphics i could rebuild this particular site fairly easily in about 2 weeks. it'd depend on whether it's dynamic or not. i'm not sure how many hours that would translate into cause my freelance experience has historically been informal, if and when i ever bother with it (they expect me to ask for the wage i want and who the hell knows what to say?).<BR><BR>my flash contacts are worse. i am literally the only flash developer working in this whole building, to my knowledge, and you know i don't get around much. in lieu of a recommendation, i'd take a look if your boss wanted to email me his ideas, but remember that i'm not a designer so he/she'd need access to their own resources.<BR><BR>and if that doesn't have you feeling confident about the whole thing, i don't know what would.<BR><BR>on the personal side, it's good to hear from you. we're all hearing reports that you're 1) kicking ass; and 2) taking names out there, so congrats on that. i've always thought it'd be nice to see more of you and doug, but it's hard to keep up with your ambitious and metropolitan lifestyle, especially while maintaining that precious leisurely quality of our own. but yeah, i'm sorry i missed out on portland, too.<BR><BR>i hope all's well. don't be a stranger,<BR>-matt

hey brother, glad to hear from you. i've tried to find you on here before, i think, but i guess you hadn't signed up yet. <BR><BR>that's really cool that you've got a family going. where did you meet your wife? my brother steve is married with 2-year-old twin sons. they're way awesome but i've only been able to hang out with them a few times cause steve's been living out west for work.<BR><BR>laura and i have been dating for about 4 and a half years now, and we got engaged on vacation in new orleans back in march. we have an apartment in norfolk, where she's a social worker and i do web programming. the money's great for how little i have to do, but i have no attachment to the company; it's just a job for now.<BR><BR>i got the job thanks to an associate's degree from ECPI, but like i said, i don't wanna do this forever, so this summer i started on a bachelor's in creative writing at ODU. i don't start an actual writing class until fall semester, but i'm hoping it will serve to jumpstart me creatively.<BR><BR>life is pretty chill right now, so me and laura aren't that active planning the wedding yet. we'll probably have it next year sometime, but you may remember that i'm not exactly mr. social, so it'll take me a while to come to terms with the idea of being slightly left of center in a big blowout bash.<BR><BR>my other brothers are doing well, too. phil's had a steady girlfriend for a couple of years now and has taken up woodworking and is in engineering school. and andy is 15 now and is mostly skateboarding his ass off. my brothers are actually among my best friends these days. i'm over there most weekends, doing laundry, playing videogames and trying to keep up with skating.<BR><BR>if you noticed the GI joe avatar i drew for my facebook profile, then you can probably guess my interests haven't changed much. for a while there i was really into comic books, and i collected hundreds and hundreds of graphic novels. i've been challenging myself to draw more lately (actually it's more like doodling at work), and i'm sort of planning to make my own comic based on GI joe just for fun. it's kinda funny in a way that you contacted me now of all times, cause i've been thinking about that old stuff kind of a lot lately.<BR><BR>the comics eventually grew into a love of reading, so i've been soaking up a steady stream of novels for a few years now. that's my drug of choice, i guess you could say, hence the interest in an english degree.<BR><BR>anyway, as you can see, i have no problem writing a facebook message all afternoon, so i'd be happy to keep this dialogue going. write me back and let me know how everyone's doing. the old neighborhood just isn't the same without your grampa around to chat everyone up. did your kids at least get a chance to know him a little?<BR><BR>thanks for finding me. there's nobody but family i still speak to that i've known as long as you. i look forward to hearing back.<BR><BR>take care,<BR>-matt

It gotta be nice to be able to work and still have time for school, and all your hobbies. <BR><BR>Good that your whole family is doing so well! I've talked with Steve a couple of times on facebook.

I dont know if you remember I used to go to camp for a week in the summer and thats where I meet my wife Amanda. I was like 15. You'll be aiight on the whole wedding thing. It's really gonna be just for your wife. You'll be an after thought, trust me. It's all for and about the woman. Hope you let me know when its gonna be so i can come.<BR><BR>Well glad I found you and were talking again. Feels good to have such a close friend back. Let me know if you want to come up for a day or two and will set it up. Me and the fam are coming down to the beach on the 28-30. So maybe we can get up and get something to eat or something.

<div class="subject">real talk note</div>

i was writing this as a comment but it got too long.<BR><BR>you managed to be very honest (even if you delete this and it ends up just as honesty with yourself) and still entertaining in this note.<BR><BR>most of the things you mention here are things we all struggle with to varying degrees - mostly stemming from physical or intellectual vanity. i think it's part of modern american culture to worry about body image - even if you are not consciously affected by axe body spray ads, they work their way into your perceptions. every single one of us has that problem.<BR><BR>but it's the other type of vanity that really affects people like you and me, i think.<BR><BR>one part of it is the way we sculpt ourselves into the people we want to be. as a kid, i desperately wanted to be deep, adult. i showed people my terrible poetry for the same reason i hide it now (and why i can't mention it without a disclaimer about its quality): it's an effort to control how people perceive me. there's comes a moment (or perhaps a series of moments), though, when you realize that it's ok to want people to like you.<BR><BR>i dressed oddly and acted weird in high school, but made up pseudo-philosophical explanations about why i did it and how it wasn't for attention, but the truth is that i was trying to be someone who i (and by extension, others) found interesting. where once i would shamefully leave out an open sketchbook for someone to notice, hoping to trick people into being impressed with me, i can now show someone a comic i've made, point to it and say, &quot;i'm proud of this.&quot;<BR><BR>the other thing is this horror at having grown up without accomplishing anything, and i think it's related to a sense of entitlement we grew up with.<BR><BR>when we were teenagers, we were the ones who thought we were literally too cool for school, thought we would run off when we turned 18, thought we were made for greatness. we are of a class of society with greater than average minds and ambitions, but just beneath the class of people we saw ourselves as, because we lack the strength of character to admit what we want and a willingness to work hard for it.<BR><BR>i used to tell myself it was an epidemic in our age group, a side effect of the escalation of this american dream mentality, but it's not. there are people our age who are accomplishing things, just like there are people from other generations who slipped through the cracks and felt as disillusioned as we do.<BR><BR>(this is what appealed to me about the movie revolutionary road, and why i was subsequently disappointed in the empty, convenient conclusion).<BR><BR>if i had the balls to pursue writing, that's what i would write about.<BR><BR>we are elitists who have never done anything to qualify as elite. we are artists who do not make art. we are not brave enough or sure enough to capitalize on our potential, so we let our potential serve in the void of accomplishment, satisfied to hold onto a secret that makes us feel superior. but not really satisfied, not under the surface, not when we stop swimming and let ourselves reflect.<BR><BR>anyway, you did a brave thing and i thought it warranted both recognition and discussion. sorry if i contribute to your self-concsiousness sometimes. i know we riff on each other a lot, but i don't mean it; you're someone i respect.

hey i heard holiday was closing this year. wild and crazy. <BR><BR>anyway, laura was thinking that since some of you kids are going to need jobs, you and/or alaine in particular might want to apply at her starbucks. they are looking to hire several people right now, and while it isn't great money, it's better than minimum wage and there are some benefits (both in the corporate sense and in the sense that you get all the free starbucks beverages you can drink). <BR><BR>i know you will probably have work for a while, tearing up the stores and everything, and that alaine went back to the video store as a backup a few times, but we thought we should let you know. seems like alaine had some complaints about her coworkers or something, so if nothing else, at starbucks you'd be working with laura and dyanna.<BR><BR>if you were interested, you could call me or laura for more details or just put in an application. laura would hook you up.<BR><BR>either way, gimme a call soon so we can fucking chill. you can come have breakfast with us in norfolk again this weekend if you want.<BR><BR>later on, brother.

yes, all my scrabble playing will be sponsored by dominion enterprises. i get so sick of computers that i only ever touch one when i'm paid for it. i often get stuck in this mindset of logical analysis, to the point where i can't stop writing programs in my head to find the most efficient way to walk down the street. that's why i need to steal time from work to distract myself by jumbling letters and so forth.<BR><BR>anyway, i guess you win the prize for most compassionate job to report while catching up. <BR>&quot;hey matt, how've you been? what do you do now?&quot;<BR>&quot;oh, computer bullshit. what about you?&quot;<BR>&quot;i teach sick babies with pure love.&quot;<BR><BR>way to be on the cutting edge of humanitarianism. pretty impressive. and it's really great that it's satisfying. maybe if i wasn't shamefully devoid of the desire to help others i might find some professional satisfaction, too.<BR><BR>just don't get any funny ideas about having those reclusive little prodigies help you score big in scrabble. i really tried to resist making that insensitive remark, but i'm weak. now, a quick distraction:<BR><BR>boston, eh? awesome?
