<h2>what the eff have you done?</h2>
<span class="time">February 9, 2009 at 12:47 pm</span>
<div class="notebody">i&#039;m gonna see if i can get a bunch of us to do this silly thing, too.  i omitted a couple of things that were either too corny or too universal, and added some of my own at the bottom.<BR /><BR />THINGS FROM THE LIST THAT I HAVE DONE<BR />skipped school - notoriously, constantly. mostly study block, though, which doesn&#039;t count anyway.<BR /><BR />watched someone die - greg and i watched thomas the brave die, but he was a bird we caught while we were working at holiday.<BR /><BR />been to canada - family vacation, 10-12 years old maybe. was baffled by metric measurements in the hotel pool. can i touch bottom in 1.032 meters or not?<BR /><BR />been on a plane - not until i was 20.<BR /><BR />been to DC - smithsonian field trip in 11th grade and again to visit adrianne with laura. enough time passed in between for it to be considered my first time again, though, or else we wouldn&#039;t have paid for the street map.<BR /><BR />swam in the ocean - to people in VB, it&#039;s weird that this is even on the list.<BR /><BR />played cops and robbers - not as fun as g.i. joes, but there were plenty of brothers and neighborhood kids my whole life.<BR /><BR />done something you told yourself you wouldn&#039;t - i don&#039;t make new year&#039;s resolutions so much as daily ones, usually about the ingredients and quantities of food i consume, usually broken immediately. like, literally immediately.<BR /><BR />caught a snowflake on your tongue - seems like it used to snow at least a few times every winter when i was a kid. haven&#039;t seen snow that really counts for at least 3 years. every year i hope i&#039;ll get another chance to run and slide on the ice again. maybe god is just trying to keep me alive.<BR /><BR />gone ice skating - best friend ben&#039;s birthday party in elementary school one year. seems like it was relatively easy right away. how come on snow or water there are equivalents to both skateboarding and rollerblading, but there is no such thing as an &quot;ice board&quot;? like a little sled you could kickflip on. wait...<BR /><BR />written a letter to Santa Claus - i was really big on santa. there is home video footage of me at maybe 5 years old, dictating a collaborative santa letter to my big brother, but he seems more interested in getting spelling assistance from my mom than benefiting from my contributions.<BR /><BR />seen a falling star and made a wish - not 100% on this, but it seems reasonable. incidentally, i was thinking the other day that it would be neat to see the planets through a telescope, but not neat enough to buy my own telescope or actually pay attention to the science of it.<BR /><BR />laid down outside at night and admired the stars - it really does seem like you can&#039;t see as many stars in the sky anymore. it was worth it out in utah. i think i would need to go camping to really appreciate this but, you know, mosquitoes.<BR /><BR />seen whales in the ocean - haven&#039;t really been to the beach since i was a kid, but every now and again somebody will point out a whale or some dolphins, i think.<BR /><BR />been to Niagara Falls - rode &quot;the maid in the mist,&quot; be-poncho-ed, from the canadian side, and saw the falls museum as well. they have a bunch of vehicles people made to go over the falls in - people who died.<BR /><BR />seen the Statue of Liberty - from a distance with laura. we wouldn&#039;t pay to ride the ferry. <BR /><BR />-----<BR /><BR />THINGS FROM THE LIST THAT I HAVE NOT DONE<BR />gone on a blind date - or any official &quot;date,&quot; really. just hang out with me a few times, then you&#039;re my girlfriend.<BR /><BR />been to Mexico - watch the movie &quot;traffic&quot; and read the book &quot;the ruins.&quot; no thank you.<BR /><BR />been to Florida - never had a reason. i tend only to visit places where there&#039;s someone to invite me, and my grandparents (75%) are in heaven*, not florida. <BR />*the vonnegut way<BR /><BR />been to Hawaii - only through the magic of &quot;a very brady sequel.&quot;<BR /><BR />been on a helicopter - if i got to, i think i&#039;d like to recreate the helicopter scene from jurassic park. dibs on dr. grant. phil gets to be ian malcolm.<BR /><BR />cried yourself to sleep - i would have cried in bed as a teenager, but i don&#039;t know if it is technically possible to fall asleep while crying. side note: my mom says i didn&#039;t cry much as a baby. i guess i was afraid of what baby society might think of me.<BR /><BR />colored with crayons as a adult - i prefer crayola washable markers.<BR /><BR />paid for a meal with coins only - depends on how you classify a &quot;meal.&quot;<BR /><BR />been to the top of the St. Louis Arch - i don&#039;t even know what that is, although i feel like i can make a good guess based on context clues.<BR /><BR />made prank phone calls - not my sense of humor, or my temperament. i&#039;ve been present for them though, and contributed background information. hmm, is it cool to have been in on a practical joke, or dorky to have filled the role of researcher?<BR /><BR />been down Bourbon Street in New Orleans - bad joke: do they have a juicy juice street?<BR /><BR />laughed until some kind of beverage came out of your nose - have probably laughed myself into a beverage accident, but thankfully no nostrils have been involved.<BR /><BR />been kissed under the mistletoe - we never had any mistletoe at my house, so this is one tradition that i never identified with. what an oddly-named shrubbery.<BR /><BR />watched the sunrise with someone - wouldn&#039;t this take several minutes? boring. even if i was outside during a sunrise, i think it&#039;d be more like &quot;experiencing&quot; a sunrise than &quot;watching&quot; one.<BR /><BR />been scuba diving - no one ever offered, but i might be too scared to breathe out of a tank and to go into deep water. how deep before your lungs start being crushed?<BR /><BR />driven across the United States - made it as far as chicago or colombus, ohio.<BR /><BR />been in a hot air balloon - i&#039;m not comfortable with traveling in a basket. i&#039;ll take something with a roof, please.<BR /><BR />been sky diving - would never. the feeling of falling you get from a rollercoaster is enough to make me uneasy, and i imagine this is like that times 100.<BR /><BR />gone snowmobiling - snowmobiles strike me more as a mode of transportation than an activity. &quot;have you ever been automobiling? so thrilling.&quot;<BR /><BR />lived in another country - not officially, but i really felt at home for those few days in canada.<BR /><BR />enjoyed the beauty of Old Faithful Geyser - i was ambivalent to the beauty. no, i&#039;ve never been, but to be consistent, this item should have been phrased &quot;been to old faithful.&quot;<BR /><BR />gone to the top of the space needle - laura and  i were inside the space needle (there&#039;s a gift shop on ground level), but did not pay to ride the elevator(pattern?). since there were stairs in the shop, you could technically say we &quot;went up in the space needle,&quot; but no, not to the top.<BR /><BR />been on a cruise - i&#039;ve been on boats, and &quot;cruised&quot; around various bodies of water, but not the kind where you sleep in a cabin and journey performs.<BR /><BR />traveled by train - i have climbed on stationary train cars.<BR /><BR />been horseback riding - i have been on a horse&#039;s back, but he was standing still. it might have been a pony.<BR /><BR />ridden on a San Francisco cable car - no, but  i rode on one of those duck tours in boston, where they drive you around then drive into the water and the truck becomes a boat. this has been a tangentially related anecdote moment, thank you.<BR /><BR />been to Disneyland or Disneyworld - no, but i like to think of busch gardens as their little brother. and ocean breeze fun parks as their really, really little, adopted/foster brother. maybe he&#039;s a temporary foreign exchange student.<BR /><BR />been in a rain forest - i don&#039;t think they even have these anymore.<BR /><BR />ridden on an elephant - sounds awesome, but is this a reasonable thing to ask an average person? is there a company out there selling elephant rides the same way they sell skydiving tickets or is this item just for people who have worked at the circus? 3% of all survey-takers are from barnum and bailey.<BR /><BR />swam with dolphins - sort of creepy. <BR /><BR />sung karaoke - would never. i have been in karaoke bars and seen my friends sing, but didn&#039;t participate. why? because i&#039;m not the exact opposite of who i am. little known fact.<BR /><BR />-----<BR />THINGS I HAVE DONE THAT I ADDED TO THE LIST<BR />been to a rodeo - participated in a kids&#039; greased pig chasing contest, but never got a hand on him.<BR /><BR />ridden a rollercoaster - on one occasion i rode many in a single day, but have been to the theme park since then without having participated at all.<BR /><BR />been to the natural bridge - as a kid, when i was studying natural modern architecture.<BR /><BR />been in a cave - luray caverns. &quot;these are called &#039;stalagmites&#039; and this kind are &#039;stalactites.&#039; now forget which is which, it&#039;s part of the tour.&quot;<BR /><BR />been snowboarding - on a day trip as a teenager. it was organized by a local country music radio station, and we got a free box lunch. perfect fuel for a day of knocking over strangers.</div>

<h2>America != coffee &amp;&amp; America != bears</h2>
<span class="time">September 22, 2008 at 11:30 am</span>
<div class="notebody">RE: <a href="http://www.new.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=26915414906" target="_blank">http://www.new.facebook.com/home.php#/note.php?note_id=26915414906</a><BR />NOTICE: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_quarters#List_of_designs" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" onmousedown="UntrustedLink.bootstrap($(this), &quot;ac994&quot;, event);">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_quarters#List_of_designs</a><BR /><BR />  it was recently brought to my attention that many citizens across this great country are being persuaded to support a dangerous political ideology on the basis of an editorial article conceived by a seriously disturbed individual. among the claims in this slanderous rant, written by graduate student and reluctant coffeehouse patron scott blair, is the notion that a state quarter (of all things) may be what holds the key to the future of this nation, that what should motivate us, the american electorate, in choosing the leader that will carry us through the uncertain times that lie ahead, is the image selected to represent the VP candidate&#039;s home state of alaska, by way of the US mint. this opinion would be laughable were it not for support it has inspired in many among the article&#039;s audience, and the strength of conviction adopted by those supporters.<BR /><BR />  clearly, mr. blair&#039;s perspective is flawed. while even the most jaded liberal would be forced to concede that the VP candidacy of alaska&#039;s governor palin is benefited by the strength of her quarter&#039;s design (the grizzly bear, a creature as distinguished as it is daunting, strutting from a rolling brook after a successful aquatic hunt), the impact offers little consolation when compared to the virtues emanated by her opposition, senator obama of illinois. obama&#039;s character, his ability to lead, and his righteous motivation are unquestionable, all evidenced by the single strongest consideration in his favor, his own state quarter.<BR /><BR />  bursting through the illinois border, a young lincoln walks tall in opposition to the wild beast. in his right hand, he carries a book, the symbol of mankind&#039;s knowledge, the element that facilitates his dominion over all the beasts of earth. in his left, hidden behind his thigh, shielded from the curious eyes of the great creature, a weapon, the tool with which man asserts his dominance. lincoln&#039;s stoic expression says he fears no animal, no matter how ferocious. the hint of an upturned lip, a smirk afforded by the human capacity for strategy, is a minute hint that he knows he has the upper hand, that the bear&#039;s brutality is no match for his own cunning, nor the technology that is its offspring. behind him, marvels of construction and engineering, miles of land teeming with his brethren, ready to overwhelm the bear should lincoln give the word, a testament to man’s willingness to unite for the common  good, a principle of human nature embodied by obama’s campaign itself.<BR /><BR />  obama&#039;s running mate&#039;s coin, featuring a colonial statesman on horseback, adds speed and mobility to their side, and reaffirms man&#039;s mastery over nature. john mccain offers no support to palin&#039;s bear, his quarter depicting nothing but wasteland, a motionless desert spattered with embarrassingly eccentric vegetation, aiding the grizzly with nothing but inert defenses. biden&#039;s delaware quarter speaks to a time in our history when the people&#039;s will forged an impassioned government, determined to combat the unjust authority of the old order, a sentiment parallel to obama&#039;s opposition of the bush dynasty. mccain and palin would mantain the status quo, keeping power in the jaws of big business, monsters who thrive at the expense of the lower creatures, ripping and shredding as citizens flail and flop to no avail. biden&#039;s statesman and obama&#039;s lincoln challenge the mistakes of the past and fight to free the underrepresented from oppression. <BR /><BR />  in the hands of leaders who mccain and palin seek to imitate, this bear market has devastated our economy. the hooves of change will reinvigorate the US, bringing the market back to charging pace. atop his post, biden&#039;s statesman has the speed and dexterity to gallop in and overtake the bulky behemoth, to strap a muzzle across his greedy fangs, leaving the waters to the fish who&#039;d struggled to survive while the bear dashed their home to foaming droplets, sweetened with their dying blood.<BR /><BR />  scott blair&#039;s article fails to account for this massacre of the innocent, or for the similar havoc that would result from unleashing such a vicious force on the citizens of the US. the mccain/palin ticket is a dangerous proposition to the american people. we must elect obama as the representitive who will quash this natural uprising, drawing on the power of his political ancestors. we democrats must unlock this power from each illinois and delaware quarter, and with it construct the mandate that will counteract the formidable masculinity that people like mr. blair are deriving from palin&#039;s coin.<BR /><BR />  scott blair may have been the visionary who first recognized that state quarters offer detailed insight into presidential politics, but as is often the case, it has taken a new generation of review to apply true comprehension to the discoveries of its forebears. upon further scrutiny, one can see that the true heroes of coinage are those that represent the democratic ticket. while the wild bear is an admirable symbol of strength and simplicity, he is no match for the resolve of great men from america&#039;s history, whose victories have been ensured by moral superiority and strategic prowess, and whose stories speak to the very ideals that make this election important enough to warrant state quarter comparison in

<div class="comments"><div class="comment"><span class="profile">Scott Blair</span> i would just like to thank you for your vigor.<BR><BR>i would also like to point out the fact that i never expressed support for the McCain/Palin political machine, i simply gave Palin daps for representing the state with the most kick-ass quarter in the 50.  my main intent was simply to draw attention to the economic crisis and our need as citizens to love America...and money...and bears.<BR><BR>p.s. - i hate to say it, but in a straight up hand to hand battle royale (in honor of a fair fight Lincoln and the Unnamed Statesman would be allowed to use knives to counter the bear's claws and teeth) i have faith that the bear would rip Lincoln's face off and the only thing that that horse would be good for is running away.  if; however, Lincoln and his Bro-lonial Statesman friend were somehow able to slay the bear, i am confident that they would probably sustain injuries that would make them outcasts from society....you know, like...they'd lose both their arms or they'd have an eyeball that would pop out and dangle every time they sneezed.<br/><span class="time">September 22, 2008 at 12:52 pm</span></div>
