<br/>the internet!



<div class="description">
<BR><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/toddbotdotcom/me-you-nicolas-cage-the-comic-book-experience">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/toddbotdotcom/me-you-nicolas-cage-the-comic-book-experience</a><BR><BR>Salutations, internet friends! <BR>I'm Todd Webb, author of The Goldfish &amp; Bob, Casual Poet, and Tuesday Moon. I'm often asked when I'll make another comic book, and these days my answer is usually &quot;Whenever I can find the time to finish one.&quot; Well, with Kickstarter, and most importantly YOUR HELP, all that can change! Today - this VERY day - I am inviting you to become a patron of the sequential comic book cartoon arts (as they say), and in return I am offering some really fun comics and artwork...<BR><BR>Contrary to popular belief, making comics takes a lot of time and effort, and it is next to impossible to make a living doing just comics. But I've always loved making comics, and just can't give it up. Any spare minute I get is spent working on ideas for more comics. Sadly it has been harder and harder to find the time to focus on finishing my comic book projects. So a large part of the goal of this project is to help me afford the time to focus on finishing some comic books! To make it more fun for us all, I am starting with an idea I've had in the back of my head forever called NICOLAS CAGE! THE COMIC BOOK EXPERIENCE. And I want to include you every step of the way.<BR><BR>Why make a comic book about Nicolas Cage? Because I think it would be a really funny, strange, and entertaining thing to do! Also, Nicolas Cage is probably the biggest comic book fan in Hollywood (he changed his last name to Cage, after a comic book character, and named his son Kal-El) and I have a hunch it is his secret dream to BE a comic book character - so why not? I promise to make Nicolas Cage! The Comic Book Experience the best comic book it can possibly be - it will not suck! It will SHINE!<BR><BR>So what's in it for you? Besides helping an artist &quot;live his dream&quot; you get to follow along as a comic book is made, from beginning to end. From ideas, influences and inspirations to research, sketching and writing to planning, penciling and inking. I'll post weekly (at least) updates of the whole process for anyone who pledges at any amount. And any pledge amount will also get you access to a digital / online version of the finished book whenever it's done - whether it's ever published or not, you'll get to read it.<BR><BR>But if you want to give a little more, you can get a lot more. A signed copy of my book Casual Poet, or my new Seamonster record, or a large ink and crayon drawing of your family hanging out with Nic Cage! Or an actual piece of the book you're helping to make - a page of original art from Nicolas Cage! The Comic Book Experience! (And for a lot less money than original comic art usually goes for, too.) You can choose a page from my first book, The Goldfish and Bob, too. There are a bunch of other reward options - just take a look to your right.<BR><BR>What will the book be like? Part of the fun is in figuring that out as we go. But chances are it will be equal parts surreal, silly, goofy, and odd - after all, the star of the book is Nicolas Cage. Take a look at some comics over on my website to get an idea of how I draw - there's a bunch of comics about wistful robots, thoughtful mummies, Kafka and Henry David Thoreau - you can even read my book Tuesday Moon for free!<BR><BR>I hope you'll consider getting involved (and getting yourself some art). Another huge reason I'm taking the leap into this project is to connect with an audience out there for the work I love doing. Get in touch with me! Especially if you know unusual facts about Nicolas Cage that could help make this project even better! Lets have some fun with it! And remember: there is no limit to how much we can raise together! The more you pledge by the 4th of July, the more time I can invest in doing the thing I love more than anything, making comic books.<BR><BR>Thanks so much for taking the time to look at this, <BR>Todd Webb<BR>
